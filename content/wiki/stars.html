A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its gravity. The nearest star to <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> is the <a href="sun.html">Sun</a>. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light. The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names. Astronomes have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. The observable universe contains an estimated 10²² to 10²⁴ stars. Still, most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all individual stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way. A star's life begins with the gravitational(Gravity) collapse of a gaseous <a href="nebulae.html">nebula</a> of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. Its total mass is the main factor determining its evolution and eventual fate.
