<h2>Lebensraum</h2>
    <p>"Lebensraum" is a German term that translates to <strong>"living space"</strong> in English. The concept gained prominence during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the context of German geopolitical and expansionist ambitions. Lebensraum referred to the belief or ideology that a nation or a particular ethnic group required additional territory or living space in order to secure its existence and ensure the well-being of its population.

<strong>Hitler</strong> believed that Germany needed to acquire additional land to accommodate its growing population, secure access to natural resources, and establish a buffer zone against potential enemies. This ideology played a significant role in the initiation of World War II and the subsequent German conquests in Eastern Europe, leading to devastating consequences and the loss of millions of lives.</p>
